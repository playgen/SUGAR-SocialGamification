    "keywords": "Development and Deployment SUGAR is currently in active development and subject to change. We are committed to delivering a feature complete version of the components by the end of 2017. For upcoming features and development direction see the Roadmap Source Repositories All source code is provided under the Apache License, Version 2.0 and is hosten on GitHub. We welcome pull requests for bug fixes and engagement in discussion on feture development. API Service Repository Admin Web UI Repository Unity Demo Repository API Service The SUGAR API Service is build using ASP.NET Core (MVC/WebAPI) as a .NET Core project. Currently the service is built for the .NETFramework 4.6 target so will only run on Windows systems, however this will soon be made compatible with the cross-platform NetStandard runtimes. Building the WebAPI project produces a Windows executable that can be executed directly to run the service in a console mode for debugging, or alternatively the service can be hosted in IIS or IIS express. In future releases the service will be made available as a Docker image for easy deployment. Database The service currently uses MySQL for it's data storage, we reccomend using the MariaDB release if you are hosting your own database instance. In the near future the GameData key/value storage will most likely be migrated to a NoSQL data store, however no decision on this technology has been taken yet. Development Dependencies Visual Studio 2015 with Update 3 .NET Core SDK for your platform The API documentation is generated with DocFX ; currently the DNX version of this must be used for .NET Core projects Building the entire solution including client assemblies has additional requirements for compatibility with Unity3D See Below IIS Hosting The server requires the .NET Core Windows (Server Hosting) runtime URL Rewrite is reccomended to redirect HTTP requests to a HTTPS endpoint, using a web.config rewrite rule as below <rewrite> <rules> <rule name=\"HTTPS-Upgrade\" enabled=\"true\" stopProcessing=\"true\"> <match url=\"(.*)\" /> <conditions> <add input=\"{HTTPS}\" pattern=\"^OFF$\" /> </conditions> <action type=\"Redirect\" url=\"https://{HTTP_HOST}/{R:1}\" /> </rule> </rules> </rewrite> API Client The API client provides a C# interface to the RESTful API exposed by the service. The client is intended to be hosted in C# projects and in Unity3D applications. Development Dependencies JSON Serialization .NET MVC Uses the tried and tested JSON.NET library from Newtonsoft. For API consistency the C# client uses JSON.net for explicit serialization operations, however the generally released version of this library utilises System.Reflection operations that are not available in Unity's WebGL environment. This issue has been addressed by SaladLab who have produced a lightweight version of the JSON.Net library specifically for use in Unity projects ( https://github.com/SaladLab/Json.Net.Unity3D ). We have decided to use this library for the C# client regardless of the target platform as it provided all required functionality. SaladLab only currently provide this in the unitypackage format, we have packaged this for NuGet which can currently be downloaded here , however this will be published to the nuget.org package feed in the near future. For details on how to configure a local filesystem based NuGeT package feed see here . Unity Unity uses Mono in place of Microsoft's .NET implementation and provides .NET 3.5 compatibility, because of this there a number or limitations on different platforms and those that we are currently aware of are detailed below: WebClient In Unity WebGL builds the socket operations performed by the System.Net.WebClient are not available and an alternative method must be used to perform HTTP operations. This has been solved in the PlayGen.SUGAR.Client by delegating the HTTP operations to a platform specific implementation. Unity WebGL applications can use the browsers native XMLHttpRequest via external calls to a JavaScript library embedded in the project. TODO: JSLib installation instructions HTTPS Mono does not use the system certificate store and by default has no root trust certificates present causing all SSL certificates to be treated as untrusted. Mono can be configured to trust certificates from any source via the methods detailed here , however there does not currently appear to be a way to use the machines trust store by default. This issue is discussed extensively by the Unity community We have not currently arrived at a satisfactory solution with the options below being considered at present: Validate the fingerprint of specific certifictes by intercepting the validation operation as detailed here Add specific certificates corresponding to the root of trust for your instance of the API service to the mono trust store during application installation or initialization Both of these methods have limitations that undermine the security and maintenance of the system as approved certificates or fingerprints must be embedded in the application deployable. Application updates must be deployed if server certificates change. Security could be undermined if application integrity cannot be verified and binaries were tampered with by a 3rd party. Certificate revocation checks would have to be performed explicitly and could also be subject to tampering."

In order to setup a LeaderboardStandingsRequest , the following must be passed: LeaderboardToken - Used to identify the specific Leaderboard that this LeaderboardStandings applies to. GameId - The Game that this LeaderboardStandings and leaderboard is specific to. ActorId - The Actor that we are most concerned with. The actor is used in conjunction with the LeaderboardFilterType. LeaderboardFilterType - Allows you to specify how you want the results returned in relation to the actor: Top: Returns the top globally ranked actors. Near: Returns the actors in relation to the actorId Provided. This works in conjunction with the PageOffset. By default it will return a collection that contains the provided actor. Friends: If the actor is a user, only the friends of that user are returned. GroupMembers: If the actor is a group, only the members of that group are returned. PageLimit: The maximum amount of rankings to return. PageOffset: Used in conjunction with the LeaderboardFilterType Near. Example 1 - if the actorId = a user's Id, LeaderboardFilterType = Near, PageLimit = 50 and PageOffset = 0, with the user ranked 80th, a collection of rankings will be returned where the user is at position 30, with 29 rankings before and 20 after. Example 2 - if the actorId = a user's Id, LeaderboardFilterType = Near, PageLimit = 50 and PageOffset = 1, with the user ranked 40th, a collection of rankings between 51th and 100th will be returned, with the user not included. DateStart: Because the leaderboard associated with the LeaderboardStandings queries the GameData of actors to determine their ranking; you can specify a StartDate and EndDate where on the GameData added to the system during that time span will be considered in determining actors' rankings. DateEnd: The end of the date range for gameData to be considered in determining an actor's ranking. Both the DateStart and DateEnd can be left empty in which case all of the gameData for the actors will be considered. Examples LeaderboardToken = \"Player High Score\", GameId = 5, actorId = 23, LeaderboardFilterType = \"Near\", PageLimit = 20, PageOffset = 1, DateStart = null, DateEnd = null,"

    "keywords": "Entity Model A Users is the person playing the game. A Group is made up of a collection of Users. Users and Groups both derive from the Actor type. This means that objects that reference an Actor can apply to either a User or a Group. Actors can save GameData . GameData could be: A User's inventory A User's high score A Group's high score etc or any other kind of data that you need to persist between play sessions. Resources are items that can be traded or consumed. An Actor may collect 20 gems and decide to give 10 of them to another actor at a later point, resulting in both actors having 10 gems. As with GameData, Resources can be obtained and given by both Users and Groups. Leaderboards are used to calculate an Actor's ranking against other actors of the same type. One leaderboard may rank Groups by the amount of members they have, in a game where one goal is to make as big a group as possible. Another leaderboard could be the typical high score, where Users are ranked by the score they have saved in the GameData. Achievements look at the GameData of a specfic Actor to see whether they have met the completion criteria for the achievement. An achievement may check to see if an Actor's score is over 100, and if so, the Actor is evaluated as having completed the Achievement. Skills operate in the same way as Achievements but are conceptually different. A Skill has the aim of teaching the player a \"skill\" in the process of completing it. For example, a Skill may be to give 10 gems to 10 different people to complete the \"sharing\" Skill. Achievements and Skills both have Evalutation Criteria which is a set of conditions that need to be met in order for the Skill or Achievement to be considered as completed. AchievementCriteria can look for specific data in GameData. Once completed, an Achievement or Skill may offer rewards to the Actor. These rewards would be in the form of GameData. For example, an Actor may be credited with 20 points on completing an Achievement or Skill. Those 20 points would be saved in that Actor's GameData. Users can create, join and leave Groups. Users can also befriend other Users. Because there may be multiple Games , the Game is used to associate Achievements, Skills, Leaderboards, GameData and Resources whithin that specific game. Each user has an Account . The Account is only used to faciliatate user registration and logging in. After the user has logged in, the Account is not used until the next time they log in."

Many game networks such as the Google play services, Apple gamkits, Microsoft game centre, Facebook game services and Steam Works offer achievements. Integrating multiple achievement systems into a game is time consuming. Additionally platform providers regularly update their APIs, creating a head-ache for keeping up-to-date with multiple systems. The achievement system will provide the ability for the actors’ achievement to be recorded automatically against other 3rd party systems. Challenge system. Achievement system will be extended by adding temporal (time based) and ownership component. This extension will be referred to as Challenge. Challenges may be seen as achievements that can be suggested to actors, gifted by one actor to another, accepted or rejected by an actor, as well as tracked to see if actors attempted or abandoned them."

Example - if \"String\" is given as DataType, only data also stored as \"String\" will be checked against. CriteriaQueryType - The type of query that will be performed against the collected data. \"Any\" checks to see if the criteria has been ever met by the collected data. \"Latest\" checks if the last data that matched Key and GameDataType met the criteria. \"Sum\" is used by numeric EvaluationDataTypes (Long and Float) and adds the value of all collected data together. ComparisonType - How the retrieved data will be compared against the target value. If the retrieved data compared to the value matches the ComparisonType provided, then the criteria has been met. Example - if the retrieved data equals 20, the value is 15 and the ComparisonType is \"GreaterThan\", the criteria has been met.

When the transfer is made, it adds the resource quantity to the target user, and subtracts it from the source user. private void TransferResource(int quantity, int targetUser) { // create a ResourceTransferRequest var resourceTransferRequest = new ResourceTransferRequest { GameId = _gameId, SenderActorId = _userId, RecipientActorId = targetUser, Key = \"ValyrianSteel\", Quantity = quantity, }; // transfer the resources from the user to the target _resourceClient.Transfer(resourceTransferRequest); } Roadmap Read/write access management for group resources Extended permissions. Proving mechanism to set ownership, and control of usage access. For example a player may own an item in the game which they can ‘lend’ to another player to use for a period, without the other player owning it. *Extended metadata. Providing mechanism to record additional metadata against resources such as being able to rate them or track a history of owners or uses. *Tradable resources Providing mechanism for actors to trade and exchange resource, including management of agreement by multiple parties through escrow system."

    "keywords": "Leaderboard Leaderboards provide a visual comparison tool for measurements of resources or objects associated with actors. A wide variety of leaderboards are supported including those based achievement or resource based on individual, group or single and multiple games. Leaderboards can utilise any GameData , Actor , Skill or Resource . Features Generate a leaderboard by: Game / Resource / Skill / Actor ActorType (Group, Player) Key (from GameData, Resource, Actor, Skill) Aggregation of values by: Frequency Summation Earliest/Latest occurrence Highest/Lowest overall occurrence Filter results by threshold values (e.g. top 20 or around current player's rank) or Relationships API Client LeaderboardClient Contracts LeaderboardRequest LeaderboardResponse LeaderboardStandingsRequest LeaderboardStandingsResponse LeaderboardType LeaderboardFilterType EvaluationDataType CriteriaScope ActorType Examples Create a leaderboard This example shows how to create a leaderboard which will display the highest rankings for the combined total of kingdoms the players have conquered. This uses LeaderboardClient 's Create function, passing a LeaderboardRequest as the parameter. This request will specify the identifier token \"MOST_KINGDOMS_CONQUERED\", key for which to check in GameData \"KingdomsConquered\" and LeaderboardType Cumulative to add all the values of every entry matching the key. The code will then store the Token of the leaderboard from the LeaderboardResponse for later use. public SUGARClient sugarClient = new SUGARClient(BaseUri); private LeaderboardClient _leaderboardClient; private int _gameId; private string _leaderboardToken; private void CreateLeaderboard() { // create instance of the leaderboard client _leaderboardClient = sugarClient.Leaderboard; // create a LeaderboardRequest var leaderboardRequest = new LeaderboardRequest { GameId = _gameId, Name = \"Most Kingdoms Conquered\", Token = \"MOST_KINGDOMS_CONQUERED\", Key = \"KingdomsConquered\", ActorType = ActorType.User, GameDataType = GameDataType.Long, CriteriaScope = CriteriaScope.Actor, LeaderboardType = LeaderboardType.Cumulative }; // create the leaderboard and store the response var leaderboardResponse = _leaderboardClient.Create(leaderboardRequest); // store the token of the leaderboard for use in other functions _leaderboardToken = leaderboardResponse.Token; } Get standings for a leaderboard To display the leaderboard inside the game, the current standings of the leaderboard must be retreived. The LeaderboardClient 's CreateGetLeaderboardStandings function is called by passing a LeaderboardStandingsRequest object as the parameter, which specifies filters for the returned results. This example will retreive the 8 rankings nearest to the player by setting the LeaderboardFilterType to Near, the limit to 8 and offset as 0. The returned LeaderboardStandingsResponse contains all the data to populate the visual representation of the leaderboard. private void GetLeaderboardStadings() { // create a LeaderboardStandingsRequest var leaderboardStandingsRequest = new LeaderboardStandingsRequest { LeaderboardToken = _leaderboardToken, GameId = _gameId, ActorId = _userId, LeaderboardFilterType = LeaderboardFilterType.Near, PageLimit = 8, PageOffset = 0 }; // retreive the standings and store the responses var leaderboardStandingsResponse = _leaderboardClient.CreateGetLeaderboardStandings(leaderboardStandingReqeusts); // output the leaderboard foreach (var standing in leaderboardStandings) { Console.WriteLine(standing.Ranking.ToString() + \" | \" + standing.ActorName + \" | Conquered: \" + standing.Value); } }"

Quick Start To run the SUGAR docker services without having to build the SUGAR image, run the docker/docker-compose_image_deploy script. This will use the latest docker image of SUGAR from the Automated Builds and create and link the database container. Automated Builds Using the automated build service , Docker Hub does a build of SUGAR each time a commit is pushed to the master branch on GitHub . You can find and download the image here . Building To build and run SUGAR, run the docker/docker-compose_build_deploy script. This will build the SUGAR image using the Dockerfile in the root of the repository, and then create and link the database container. Configuration Dockerfile The Dockerfile for SUGAR is in the project root. It is built off the base image recommended by Microsoft for .NETCoreApp2.0 applications. It copies the contents of the SUGAR repository into the filesystem of the container. The container contains the necessary environment to build this project thanks to the base image provided by Microsoft. The next steps restore the NuGet packages, build the project and launch the server via the PlayGen.SUGAR.Server.WebAPI entrypoint. Docker-Compose file The SUGAR docker-compose files have been split into 3 parts: docker-compose.image.yml : this has the configuration to pull the SUGAR image from DockerHub. docker-compose.build.yml : this has the configuration to build SUGAR image from source. docker-compose.base.yml : this contains all the shared settings for the SUGAR container as well as the database and inter-container links. docker-compose.image.yml See the docker/docker-compose_image_deploy script. It uses this in conjunction with docker-compose.base.yml . docker-compose.build.yml See the docker/docker-compose_build_deploy script. It uses this in conjunction with docker-compose.base.yml . docker-compose.base.yml The SUGAR compose configuration requires the sugar-mariadb container which hosts the databse. This is simply built from the mariadb image. When launching SUGAR, one of the first steps it does is to setup the database which requires it to be able to connect to the database within the sugar-mariadb container. If the database takes longer to startup than the SUGAR server, the server will attempt to connect to the database and fail. This is the reason for the wait-for-db container. It's purpose is to stay active until the database is fully initialized and ready to accept connections. This compose file along with the command sequence in the docker-compose_deploy scripts ensures that the container SUGAR is only launched after the database is ready. Currently the SUGAR container is set to map port 5000 within the container to 5000 on the host meaning you can access the api on the host machine via: http://localhost:5000/api/version ."
